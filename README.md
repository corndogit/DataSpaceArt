# DataSpaceArt
A generative art project which generates stylized patterns from data. Written in Python by corndogit for the purpose of
displaying as an art piece for the Arts Arkade digital arts hub in Swansea.

## Overview
DataSpaceArt is a project for generating patterns with parameters which are altered by data. For this project, weather 
data from the Met Office DataHub API is used to change the parameters of the Hilbert curve, such as colour range for the curve,
length, background colour, etc.    

The aim of the project is to turn any type of quantitative data into a meaningful visual representation. With weather as
the choice of data, the goal is to generate a curve for each day of the month, using the daily weather data for Swansea.
This will then be displayed at Arts Arkade, the digital arts hub in the city centre.  

## Usage  
A `setup.py` script will be written to install necessary libraries for the program to run.  

Run `main.py`, and a curve will be generated. Currently, the code for retrieving weather data works, but has not been
implemented into the generation of the curve yet.

### Example:

## How it works  
Data comes from a Met Office DataHub API request, returning an JSON containing an extensive
amount of useful weather data for a given set of latitude and longitude coordinates. The code for this is adapted from
one of my other projects, [weather-cli](https://github.com/corndogit/weather-cli).  

Coordinates for a 2-dimensional Hilbert curve, which is a type of space-filling curve, are generated by 
[hilbertcurve](https://github.com/galtay/hilbertcurve) is plotted using matplotlib with the order determined by some data from 
the input. The data is also used to set a colour range generated by [colour.py](https://github.com/vaab/colour) 
to apply along the length of the curve, the colour of the background, etc.  

More possible applications are being explored currently.
## Todo
- [x] Implement numpy arrays to replace the very long lists created by curves with p > 7
- [ ] Use data from weather JSON to change colour range of the curve using max/min temperature 
- [ ] Come up with more ways to change the output 
- [ ] Plan how to take the output from the program and display it (e.g. on a webpage)
- [x] Write setup.py script to install dependencies locally
